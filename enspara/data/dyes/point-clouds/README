AF488 and AF594 PDB files are point clouds that represent the distribution
of possible dye heads from different fluorophores. These are from several 
ns of simulation from:

Stuchell-Brereton MD, Zimmerman MI, Miller JJ, Mallimadugula UL, Incicco JJ, 
Roy D, Smith LG, Cubuk J, Baban B, DeKoster GT, Frieden C, Bowman GR, Soranno A. 
Apolipoprotein E4 has extensive conformational heterogeneity in lipid-free and
 lipid-bound forms. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2023 Feb 14;120(7):e2215371120. 
doi: 10.1073/pnas.2215371120. Epub 2023 Feb 7. PMID: 36749730; PMCID: PMC9963066.

Remaining dye pairs are from FRET Predict Library and generated using 
make_point_clouds.py with the original trajectories.
